Agile is a project management approach that focuses on delivering value iteratively and incrementally. Here are some key points to explain Agile:

1. Iterative approach: Agile breaks down projects into smaller increments called iterations or sprints, allowing for continuous planning, learning, and adaptation.

2. Customer collaboration: Agile emphasizes customer collaboration throughout the project to ensure the final product meets customer needs and expectations.

3. Adaptive planning: Agile allows for flexibility in planning and responds to changes quickly, making it easier to adapt to evolving requirements.

4. Emphasis on individuals and interactions: Agile values communication, collaboration, and teamwork among team members, which fosters innovation and high-quality results.

5. Emphasis on working software/product: Agile prioritizes delivering a working product incrementally, ensuring that tangible value is produced at the end of each iteration.

6. Continuous improvement: Agile encourages regular reflection and adaptation to improve processes, product quality, and team performance.
