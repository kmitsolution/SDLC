Project management involves overseeing and guiding a project from its inception to completion. It encompasses various components and processes to ensure successful delivery of the project. Here are some key components of project management:

1. **Project Initiation**: This phase involves defining the project at a broad level. Project managers identify the project's purpose, scope, objectives, and stakeholders.

2. **Planning**: In this phase, project managers develop a roadmap that outlines the project scope, budget, timeline, resources, and risks. Detailed planning helps in setting clear expectations and defining project deliverables.

3. **Execution**: During this phase, project plans are put into motion. Resources are allocated, team members are assigned tasks, and the project work is carried out according to the project plan.

4. **Monitoring and Controlling**: Project progress is monitored and tracked against the project plan. Project managers ensure that the project stays on track and take corrective actions if deviations occur. This phase involves risk management, quality control, and issue resolution.

5. **Closing**: Once the project deliverables are met and accepted by the stakeholders, the project is closed out. A final project report is prepared, lessons learned are documented, and resources are released.

6. **Communication Management**: Effective communication is crucial throughout the project lifecycle. Project managers need to communicate with stakeholders, team members, and other relevant parties to ensure clarity and alignment on project goals and progress.

7. **Risk Management**: Identifying potential risks, analyzing their impact, and developing strategies to mitigate or respond to them is essential in project management. Proactive risk management helps in minimizing project disruptions.

8. **Quality Management**: Ensuring that the project deliverables meet the defined quality standards is a critical aspect of project management. Quality assurance processes should be integrated into the project lifecycle.

By effectively managing these components and processes, project managers can increase the likelihood of project success and deliver results that meet stakeholder expectations within the context of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
