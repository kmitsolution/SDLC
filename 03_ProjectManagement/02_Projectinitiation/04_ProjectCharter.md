**Project Charter**:
The project charter is a foundational document that formally authorizes a project's existence and provides the project manager with the authority to apply resources to project activities. It outlines the project's objectives, scope, constraints, deliverables, stakeholders, risks, assumptions, and success criteria. The project charter sets the framework for the project and ensures alignment with organizational goals and objectives.

**Terms in the Project Charter**:

1. **Objectives**: Clear, measurable goals and targets that the project aims to achieve.
2. **Scope**: The boundaries of the project in terms of what is included and excluded.
3. **Constraints**: Limitations or restrictions that may impact the project's execution.
4. **Deliverables**: Tangible outcomes or products the project is expected to produce.

**Basic Calculations in Project Charter**:

1. **Budget Estimation**:
   - Formula: Estimated Project Cost = Sum of all estimated costs (labor, materials, equipment, etc.)
   - Example: Labor ($50,000) + Materials ($20,000) + Equipment ($10,000) = $80,000

2. **High-Level Resource Requirements**:
   - Formula: Total Resource Hours = Sum of hours needed for all resources
   - Example: Developer (200 hours) + Designer (100 hours) + Tester (150 hours) = 450 hours

3. **Timeline Estimation**:
   - Formula: Total Project Duration = Sum of individual task durations
   - Example: Task 1 (5 days) + Task 2 (3 days) + Task 3 (4 days) = 12 days

**Case Study**:

**Project**: Implementing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system

1. **Budget Estimation**:
   - Labor: Development Team ($40,000), Testing Team ($20,000)
   - Materials: Software Licenses ($10,000), Hardware Upgrade ($5,000)
   - Estimated Project Cost = $40,000 + $20,000 + $10,000 + $5,000 = $75,000

2. **High-Level Resource Requirements**:
   - Development Team: 500 hours, Testing Team: 250 hours
   - Total Resource Hours = 500 hours + 250 hours = 750 hours

3. **Timeline Estimation**:
   - Task 1: Requirements Gathering (10 days), Task 2: Development (20 days), Task 3: Testing (15 days)
   - Total Project Duration = 10 days + 20 days + 15 days = 45 days

In this case study, the project charter for implementing a CRM system provides a comprehensive overview of project objectives, scope, constraints, and deliverables while including basic calculations for budget estimation, resource requirements, and timeline estimation. These calculations help in setting realistic targets and expectations for the project and ensure effective project management and delivery.
