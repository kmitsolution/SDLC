# Incident Management
Incident Management is the process of managing and resolving unplanned interruptions or incidents in IT services to restore normal operations as quickly as possible and minimize impact on business operations. It focuses on rapid response and resolution to ensure service continuity and minimize disruption to users. Let's explore the Incident Management process using an example case study within the context of SDLC and ServiceNow.

### Incident Management Process Example:

**1. Incident Detection:**
   - **Detection:** During the testing phase of an SDLC project for a new e-commerce platform, users report issues accessing the checkout page intermittently. They encounter error messages indicating "server timeout" when trying to complete purchases.

**2. Incident Logging and Categorization:**
   - **Logging:** Users or support personnel log incidents in ServiceNow, describing symptoms, affected functionality (checkout page), and impact on business operations (potential revenue loss during peak hours).
   - **Categorization:** ServiceNow categorizes the incident based on severity (high priority due to impact on revenue) and initial assessment of root cause (server performance issue).

**3. Incident Prioritization and Initial Diagnosis:**
   - **Prioritization:** Incident Management within ServiceNow prioritizes incidents based on severity and impact. High-priority incidents like checkout failures during peak shopping periods receive immediate attention.
   - **Initial Diagnosis:** Support teams conduct initial diagnosis using ServiceNow's integrated monitoring tools to identify the root cause, such as server overload due to high transaction volume.

**4. Incident Resolution and Escalation:**
   - **Resolution Attempts:** Support teams attempt to resolve the incident promptly, following documented procedures or known workarounds within ServiceNow.
   - **Escalation:** If resolution efforts fail or if escalation criteria are met (e.g., prolonged downtime), the incident may be escalated to higher-level support or management for additional resources or expertise.

**5. Incident Closure and Documentation:**
   - **Closure:** Once the incident is resolved, ServiceNow updates the incident record to reflect the actions taken, resolution details, and any follow-up actions required.
   - **Documentation:** Incident details and resolution steps are documented in ServiceNow's knowledge base to aid in future incident handling and prevent similar issues.

### Case Study Example:

**Scenario:** A software development team is deploying a new checkout feature on an e-commerce platform as part of an SDLC project. During load testing, users begin reporting intermittent server timeouts when trying to complete purchases.

**ServiceNow Integration:**
- **Incident Management:** Incidents are promptly logged in ServiceNow, detailing symptoms and impact on revenue-generating functionality.
- **Priority:** ServiceNow categorizes incidents as high priority due to their impact on business operations and potential revenue loss.
- **Diagnosis and Resolution:** Using ServiceNow's integrated monitoring tools, the team identifies server overload during peak transaction periods as the root cause. They implement a temporary fix to optimize server resources and improve checkout page performance.
- **Escalation:** If the issue persists despite initial fixes, ServiceNow facilitates escalation to higher-level support teams or management for further investigation and resolution.
- **Post-Incident Review:** ServiceNow captures post-incident review details, including lessons learned and preventive measures implemented to enhance system performance during future deployments.

### Incident Management in Relation to Problem and Change Management:

- **Position in ITSM:** Incident Management typically occurs before Problem Management and Change Management in the IT Service Management (ITSM) lifecycle.
- **Purpose:** Incident Management focuses on restoring services quickly to minimize disruption, whereas Problem Management investigates underlying causes to prevent incidents from recurring.
- **Relationship:** Incidents may lead to the identification of underlying problems through patterns or recurring issues, which are then addressed by Problem Management. Change Management ensures that permanent fixes or improvements identified by Problem Management are implemented effectively without causing further disruption.

In summary, Incident Management plays a crucial role in maintaining service continuity and minimizing business impact during SDLC phases. ServiceNow facilitates effective incident handling by providing a structured approach to logging, prioritizing, diagnosing, and resolving incidents promptly to ensure service reliability and user satisfaction.
