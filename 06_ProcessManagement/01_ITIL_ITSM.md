**ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)** is a framework of best practices for IT service management (ITSM). It provides guidance on aligning IT services with the needs of the business, focusing on delivering value and maintaining service quality. ITIL is widely adopted globally and helps organizations establish processes and procedures to improve efficiency and effectiveness in IT service delivery.

**ITSM (IT Service Management)** encompasses all activities, processes, and policies used by an organization to design, plan, deliver, operate, and control IT services offered to customers. ITSM aims to align the delivery of IT services with the needs of the organization, emphasizing customer satisfaction and continuous improvement.

### Key Processes in ITIL/ITSM:

1. **Change Management:**
   - **Definition:** Change Management is the process of controlling changes to the IT infrastructure or any IT service, ensuring that standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes.
   - **Objective:** To minimize the impact of changes on IT services, ensuring that changes are beneficial, and that risks are managed appropriately.
   - **Activities:** Includes evaluating, prioritizing, authorizing, scheduling, and overseeing changes.

2. **Problem Management:**
   - **Definition:** Problem Management aims to minimize the adverse impact of incidents and problems on the business that are caused by errors within the IT infrastructure and to prevent recurrence of incidents related to these errors.
   - **Objective:** To identify the root cause of incidents and to initiate actions to improve or correct the situation.
   - **Activities:** Includes problem identification, logging, categorization, prioritization, investigation, diagnosis, resolution, and proactive problem management to prevent future incidents.

3. **Incident Management:**
   - **Definition:** Incident Management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all incidents, restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible, and minimizing the adverse impact on business operations.
   - **Objective:** To restore normal service operation as quickly as possible and to minimize the impact on business operations, ensuring quality and timely resolution of incidents.
   - **Activities:** Includes incident identification, logging, categorization, prioritization, diagnosis, escalation, resolution, and closure.

### Example Use Case:
- **Scenario:** A company using ITIL/ITSM faces a critical server outage affecting customer-facing applications.
- **Response:**
  - **Incident Management:** The incident is quickly identified and logged. The support team categorizes it as critical and prioritizes it accordingly. They work to restore services swiftly, keeping stakeholders informed.
  - **Problem Management:** Simultaneously, the problem management team investigates the root cause of the outage to prevent it from happening again in the future.
  - **Change Management:** If a change is identified as the cause of the incident, the change management process ensures that any further changes are evaluated and implemented carefully to avoid similar incidents.

ITIL/ITSM frameworks ensure that these processes are well-defined, documented, and followed consistently across the organization, leading to improved service delivery, reduced downtime, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
